## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid blue (#29ABE2) to evoke a sense of trust and competence.
- Background color: Light blue (#E0F7FA), a desaturated version of the primary color for a calm, focused environment.
- Accent color: A contrasting orange (#FFB347) is used for interactive elements to grab attention.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for a clean and modern user experience.
- Clear, modern layout using shadcn/ui components to enhance usability and visual appeal. Cards are used to separate the sections of the application, buttons have descriptive labels and the use of normal line height will maintain a reasonable level of readbility.
